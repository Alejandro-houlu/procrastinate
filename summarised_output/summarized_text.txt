Lecturer: Today we're just going to do an overview of computer graphics with two main objectives. One is to try to understand broadly what computer graphics is all about, where does it show up in the world, and we're actually going to really get our hands on a first algorithm for making images from 3D shapes. All information about course logistics is on the webpage. Today I'm really gonna dive into the content. Okay, so what is computer graphics? Why are we here? What do we want to talk about this semester? When you think about computer graphics, probably an image like this one comes to mind, something from maybe an animated movie, visual effects. Why is visual information so important? There are a lot of other ways that we could have tried to get information out of the machine. We could have played sound or had kind of vibration. But why are we so focused on visual information in computer science and computer graphics well one reason is that 30 percent of your brain is dedicated to visual processing. So if you're trying to get info from a machine into your mind, doing something visual makes a whole lot of sense. And we might say that computers use a computer graphics synthesizer to put together at least a tentative definition.
