This heart has more colors than black and white, don't act so surprised Every day brings a different you You gotta have a canvas for dreams to come true People always have opinions on what you're doing And they'll try to put you down All you have to do is let go of what they're saying. All the steps we take Brings us closer to what we'll achieve And all the risks we make Will pay off Just believe We'll pay off.
